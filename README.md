# Synthea-project
## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
**System Requirements**:
- SyntheaTM requires Java JDK 11 or newer. I used Java JDK 17. You can find it on the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a plus to run your commands
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to make changes were necessary
## Installation
To clone the SyntheaTM repo, then build and run the test suite (on Git Bash):
```
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
./gradlew build check test
```
